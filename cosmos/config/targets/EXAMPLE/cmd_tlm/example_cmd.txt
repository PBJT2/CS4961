#	NOTES:
#
#	example_cmd.txt was developed from the Create App command from OSK.
#	The rest were developed afterwards.
#
#	For reference, it is just:
#	COMMAND EXAMPLE ICS_DETECT
#
#	Honestly, I just worked on "COMMAND EXAMPLE ICS_DETECT"
#	That's the only new thing here.

#	For reference:

#	Where 11 is "EXAMPLE_ICSDETECT_CC" and 128 is for the CCDSS Length.
