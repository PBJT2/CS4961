# SimpleSat Ops Example Utilities
#
# These utilities help configure the COSMOS/cFS ops example runtime 
# environment. They are contained in a single file to separate them from other
# scripts that are more representative of 'real' test and operational scripts.
# For example instrument management and cFS app configuration scripts are not
# included in this file because a mission oudl typically have scripts that 
# perform those functions so they are in their own files so they can serve as
# examples.
#
# Notes:
#   1. This script is part of a training module. It is for illustrative
#      purposes and not intended to be an actual ops script. 
#   2. The background thread requests status telemetry packets to update the
#      example osp status regardless of whether or a ground contact is active. 
#   3. Threading doesn't seem to be supported by ScripRunner so a new 
#      ReqTlmThread must be started from the TlmViewer script.  
#
# Global Script Variables:
#   None - Global variables should not be used since the some are called by
#          screen scripts (i.e. TlmViewer) and others by ScriptRunner and
#          they have different runtime environments.
